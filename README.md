#Alx Specialization Webstack - Portfolio Project

#Project Topic: AI-ML-production optimizer

#Developed by: Kish, Miracle Edo (https://github.com/KishMiracle)

*AI/ML Production Optimizer Keeps your facility reliable up to 99% from upsets/trips.
This optimises processing and production facility to achieve up to 99% reliability from trips as a result of failed instruments and (or) as a result of process upsets. Process upsets can also occur as a result of changes in the physical properties (Flow, Pressure, Level, Temperature and Density) of the materials or products in the plant.

#Description of the project

In this Project we will demonstrate the power of machine learning
How machine can react to upset in production process to minimize frequent trips using scenario based approach.
Building reactive model that respond to changes in Flow, Pressure, Level, Temperature and Density. Then, provide same solution as if human would. After complete training of the model.
Create a Demo application and collect data for future use cases.

#Future Plan:

We can predict and avert short term and long term process upsets.
Read and react to process alarms and event messages to manage threats.

#Learning Objectives

Create AI/ML Model
Learn and Master Programming Languages and technologies used to develop models
Create a Demo application that can react to production upset and stabilize the plant.

#Technology Used

React ES6
Python
JavaScript
JSON
HTTP
CSS
